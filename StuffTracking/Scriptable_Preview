//Note: Destroy() and DestroyImmediate() only remove the C++ side, C# side must have all references gone


/*
Focus on data
Editable w/o code
Only one outcome/expectable outcomes

Similar to MonoBehaviour w/o Transform (same type in c++ layer)
typically saved as .asset, but can be created at runtime and can also have multiple in one

uses the Unity Inspector like an Injector

BiggerThing can reference and edit DataType (and/or DataReferences)
while OtherThing can view the same DataType

can be used for Events as well
(check about 37 minutes in)

"RuntimeSets" keep track of a list of things, mostly a type of object
multiple types of thign may require multiple lists and have them be added in to each one
different items may not need it, but flyiong vs. grounded enemies might
Also good for renderers, mini map stuff

Can also be used like Enums (Elements and/or their extensions and what they beat/lose to)

You CAN write entire objects or more inside a ScriptableObject, they aren't just "data buckets"

Inventory Example:
-ScriptableObject Master List
-ScriptableObject per item(? just to avoid changing everything)
--can have different inventories for each scene

Systems CAN interact with other systems


Shared (values used across multiple objects) v non-shared (exclusive to one instance/type) states
MonoBehaviours create sub-file granularity (possible conflicts and issues when editing)
Hard to figure out where callbacks are coming and going
ScriptableObjects can't be attached to GameObjects/Prefabs, doesn't get most callbacks, and can be serialized and inspected like MonoBehaviour

only callbacks are OnEnable(), OnDisable(), and Destroy()

Usage ends up being for seperating shared states (ScriptableObject) from non-shared (MonoBehaviour)

"dies" on deletion or Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets() //removes anything not referenced

Enum pattern uses Empty SO's, binds them to assets, and treats SO like dictionary keys

Dual Serialization with JSON/JsonUtility
